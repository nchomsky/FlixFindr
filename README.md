## Built Using:
* React
  * React Router
* Redux
  * Redux Thunk
* Axios
* Sass
* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges Encountered
* Having trouble understanding how redux all ties together
  * I definitely have a better grasp of how it works now
* Using Redux Thunk to asynchronously make requests to the API was challenging at first
 

## Future Plans and Ideas
* Add a "My List" feature
* Allow users to sign in to their accounts
* Sort by Popularity, Rating, Now Playing
* Filter by genre
